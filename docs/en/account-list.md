Account list
============

When connecting to OpenSearchServer, you'll see the list of accounts you can access.

This may include your own account, if one exists. Such accounts are labelled "owner", with matching permissions. The free test account is an owner account.

Another user may give you access to an account they own. You may be granted administrator rights, writing rights, or reading rights.

Each account is described using:

- Its account ID. This is a unique identifier (UUID).
- Its account name.
- Its permissions. These are the privileges you were granted with respect to this account.

Clicking the EDIT button is what allows for [account edition](/en/account-edition.html).
