Welcome
=======

For more than a decade, OepnSearchServer has been working to make search engine solutions more accessible.

Our objective is to allow for easier access to state-of-the-art search functionalities.

We make these less complex, freeing you to focus on your core competencies.

OpenSearchServer 2.0 brings the following core functionalities:
- Crawling Internet sites to produce full-text indexation and extract semantic information.
- Deploying fully customisable search forms and results pages.

You can implement this in two manners:
- Either as a hosted service, which you can access on [www.opensearchserver.com](http://www.opensearchserver.com).
- Or as downloadable software, offered under an Apache 2 open source licence. 

The following documentation provides the information you need to integrate OpenSearchServer with your web site.

To facilitate this, we are offering a free OpenSearchServer instance. It will allow you to integrate OSS with your Internet site within minutes.

To create your account and your free OpenSearchServer 2.0 instance, [follow this link](https://cloud.opensearchserver.com/dashboard/oss2.xhtml).
